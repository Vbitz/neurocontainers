## Voreen/5.3.0 ##

Voreen is an open source rapid application development framework for the interactive visualization and analysis of multi-modal volumetric data sets. It provides GPU-based volume rendering and data analysis techniques and offers high flexibility when developing new analysis workflows in collaboration with domain experts. The Voreen framework consists of a multi-platform C++ library, which can be easily integrated into existing applications, and a Qt-based stand-alone application. It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Example:
```
./voreentool -platform minimal -w someworkspace.vws --script somescript.py
```
